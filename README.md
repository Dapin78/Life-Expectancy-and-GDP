# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP
Analysis of life expectancy in several countries, trying to evaluate if GDP has an impact on it.
This document uses Python, and its data science libraries Matplotlib & Seaborn.
The objective is to visually and statistically assess if there is a correlation between GDP & Life Expectancy.
Finally, all data will be gathered and presented in a blog post, to communicate our findings.
